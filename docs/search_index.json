It is designed for everyone including complete beginners! You will drawn on existing data to pose research questions, and use a statistical software platform to answer those questions by turning raw data into useful information. Passion-Driven Statistics flips the traditional classroom format. Rather than attending class sessions in order to listen to lectures, you will engage with online lessons as homework and use class time to work on a research project of your own design. Chapter Description Ch 1 provides an introduction to this project-based e-book. Ch 2 describes how code books document the ways that data are arranged within data sets. Ch 3 introduces the literature review process. Ch 4 explains how to examine frequency distributions. Ch 5 describes the process of data management. Ch 6 demonstrates how and why to create univariate graphs. Ch 7 demonstrates how and why to create bivariate graphs. Ch 8 provides an overview of hypothesis testing. Ch 9 covers analysis of variance. Ch 10 covers the chi-square tests of independence. Ch 11 covers the pearson correlation coefficient. Ch 12 provides a concrete overview of of moderation, also known as statistical interaction. Ch 13 covers the important concept of causation and when it can and cannot be observed. Ch 14 presents multiple and logistic regression methods. Ch 15 gives advice on creating effective poster presentations. ii. supporting research Passion-Driven Statistics has been implemented as a statistics course, a research methods course, a data science course, a capstone experience, and a summer research boot camp with students from a wide variety of academic settings. Liberal arts colleges, large state universities, regional colleges/universities, medical schools, community colleges, and high schools have all successfully implemented the model. Research evaluating the model has been exciting to see unfold. The curriculum attracts higher rates of under-represented (UR) students compared to a traditional statistics course and students enrolled in Passion-Driven Statistics are more likely to report increased confidence in working with data and increased interest in pursuing advanced statistics coursework.The project-based curriculum has also been found to promote further training in statistics. Using causal inference techniques to achieve matched comparisons across three different statistics courses, students originally enrolled in Passion-Driven Statistics were significantly more likely to take at least one additional undergraduate course focused on statistical concepts, applied data analysis, and/or use of statistical software compared to students taking either a psychology statistics course or math statistics course.

Many student reactions have supported the positive impact of the course. In anonymous post-course evaluations, one student wrote, I have never felt so excited and motivated to be part of an academic environment as I have in this class. I am so proud of my work. Another wrote, Allowing students to pick from a study and data set to answer their own research question was effective because we became attached to our own projects, understood exactly why we were learning what we were learning, and wanted to know more. Finally, Though the structure of the class is unorthodox, the resulting education is priceless. Aside from teaching me the valuable process and application of statistical inquiry, this course taught me how to take initiative and start a scientific project that I can call my own. iii. using the e-book The e-book is broken into 15 chapters. Each provides a brief overview of what you have learned, a summary of the upcoming lesson, links to the video lessons, and a corresponding project assignment. For each chapter: 1. Read the overview and lesson summary. 2. Use the appropriate link to watch the video lesson. 3. Use the model code/instructions to complete the assignment. Model code is provided as part of several of the chapters. You can copy/paste relevant code into your own software program and make needed changes based on the variables you have selected and the formatting rules for your software platform. If you are using SPSS, lessons include both a video and a print screen tutorial. Python video lessons are segmented. After watching each segment, select the next segment on the right side of the YouTube screen (e.g., 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4). We recommend keeping a journal or lab notebook to track the progress of your project. You will find this to be a valuable research tool that saves time and unnecessary work.

Karl Pearson 1.1 Overview This course is presented in the service of a project of your choosing and will offer you an intensive hands-on experience in the quantitative research process. You will develop skills in generating testable hypotheses, understanding large data sets, formatting and managing data, conducting descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, and presenting results for expert and novice audiences. It is designed for those who are interested in developing skills that are useful for working with data and using statistical tools to analyze them. No prior experience with data or statistics is required. Our approach is statistics in the service of questions. As such, the research question that you choose (from data sets made available to you) is of paramount importance to your learning experience. It must interest you enough that you will be willing to spend many hours working to answer it. 1.2 Lesson In this lesson, you will learn about the resources available to you. This e-textbook will give you a brief introduction for each topic, a link to video lessons, example code (or point-and click instructions) for the statistical platform you will be using, and basic instructions for project-based assignments.

They are not just symbols on paper.  Shakuntala 2.1 Overview You have learned a bit about the structure and goals of the course and have heard from students who have engaged in their own research. Now you will begin to learn about the necessary steps in statistical inquiry, types of variables, and how to use code books to develop your own research question. Statistics is all about converting data into useful information. 2.2 Lesson Learn about the role of populations and samples in statistical inquiry. Understand the importance of choosing a representative sample from a population of interest. Consider the structure of a data set and the meaning and function of information provided within its rows and columns. Learn about how code books document the ways that the data are arranged within data sets, what the various numbers and letters mean, and any special instructions on how to use the data. Develop skills in reading code books and developing a research question. Click HERE to watch the video lesson. 2.3 Assignment Now it is time for you to formulate your own research question. You should spend ample time on this task as it will guide your work for the rest of the course. One of the simplest research questions that can be asked is whether two topics or constructs are associated. Is medical treatment seeking associated with income? Is water fluoridation associated with number of cavities during dentist visits? Is humidity associated with caterpillar reproduction? First, carefully read through the available code book(s). If more than one data set has been made available to you, select the one that you would like to work with. Next, identify a specific topic of interest and begin to prepare a code book of your own. Print individual pages from the larger code book (i.e. items or questions that measure your selected topic). During an additional review of the code book, identify a second topic that you would like to explore in terms of its association with your original topic. Add the items or questions documenting this second topic to your personal codebook. For example, after looking through the code book for the NESARC study, I have decided that I am particularly interested in nicotine dependence. I am not sure which items I will use regarding nicotine dependence (e.g. symptoms or a diagnosis) so for now I will include all of the relevant items in my personal codebook. While nicotine dependence is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about nicotine that I am interested in. It strikes me that friends and acquaintances that I have known through the years that became hooked on cigarettes did so across very different periods of time. Some seemed to be dependent soon after their first few experiences with smoking and others after many years of generally irregular smoking behavior. I decide that I am most interested in exploring the association between level of smoking and nicotine dependence. I add to my codebook items reflecting smoking (e.g. smoking quantity and frequency). Bring a printed copy of this personal code book to each class session. "],["literature-review.html", "Chapter 3 Literature Review 3.1 Overview 3.2 Lesson 3.3 Assignment", " Chapter 3 Literature Review Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has ever thought.  Albert Szent-Gyorgyi 3.1 Overview You have learned that a data set contains observations (i.e. the rows) and variables (i.e. the columns) and that to understand a data set you will first need to read through its code book. You are also now able to distinguish between categorical and quantitative variables. Next, we are going to focus on conducting a review of primary source journal articles in order to understand previous work conducted on your chosen research question. To conduct a literature review, you will find and read published, primary source, peer reviewed articles that have addressed your research question or questions that are similar to yours. This will allow you to better understand what is already known about the association or relationship that you will be studying. 3.2 Lesson Learn about the literature review process. Compare strengths and weaknesses of primary and secondary source scientific literature. Experience how the context and background information you find in your literature search can inform your research. Consider ways you may want to refine your topic or modify your question. Click HERE to watch the video lesson. 3.3 Assignment Describe the association that you will examine and key words you found helpful during your literature search. List at least 5 of the most appropriate references that you have found and read. Describe findings and interesting themes that you have uncovered and include the specific research question that you hope to answer. For example, given the association that I have decided to examine, I use such keywords as nicotine dependence, tobacco dependence, and smoking. After reading through several titles and abstracts, I notice that there has been relatively little attention in the research literature to the association between smoking exposure and dependence symptoms. I also expand a bit to include other substance use and dependence relationships that may provide relevant background. Example References: Dierker, L., &amp; Donny, E. (2008). The role of psychiatric disorders in the relationship between cigarette smoking and DSM-IV nicotine dependence among young adults.

Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 128(3), 230-237. doi:10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.08.026 Based on my reading of the above articles as well as others, I have noted a few common and interesting themes: First, while it is true that smoking exposure is a necessary requirement for nicotine dependence, frequency and quantity of smoking are markedly imperfect indices for determining an individuals probability of exhibiting nicotine dependence symptoms (and the same seems to be true for other substances that cause dependence symptoms). The association may differ based on ethnicity, age, and gender, although there is relatively little work on this. One of the most potent risk factors consistently implicated in the etiology of smoking behavior and nicotine dependence is depression. I have decided to further focus my question (is level of smoking associated with the likelihood of experiencing nicotine dependence?) by examining whether this association differs based on whether or not an individual has depression. I am wondering if at low levels of smoking nicotine dependence is more common among individuals with major depression than those without major depression. I add relevant depression questions/items/variables to my personal code book as well as several demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) and any other variables I may wish to consider.

You refined your research question by conducting a literature review based on primary source journal articles. Now you are ready to use statistical software to work with the data. Exploratory data analysis is the processes of converting raw data into a more useful form so that we can begin to discover important features and patterns in the data. 4.2 Lesson Learn to examine frequency distributions for each of the variables you have selected. Determine what values a variable takes and how often it takes those values. Write the code or take the steps required to generate frequency distributions using your statistical software program. As you engage with your data, learn how to consider whether or not you want to create a subset of the larger sample in order to answer your question. Click on a video lesson below.

"],["data-management.html", "Chapter 5 Data Management 5.1 Overview 5.2 Lesson 5.3 Syntax 5.4 Assignment", " Chapter 5 Data Management You can have a ridiculously enormous and complex data set, but if you have the right tools and methodology then its not a problem.  Aaron Koblin 5.1 Overview You have learned the basic steps for using your statistical software program and have begun to examine each of your variables through the process of exploratory data analysis. By generating frequency tables, you were able to describe the pattern of responses for each variable. Now we will use these frequency distributions (along with your personal code book) to make additional decisions regarding the organization of each of your variables. Data management is the process of organizing and recoding your data in order to help you answer your research question. The number and types of decisions you will need to make will depend on the variables that you have selected. 5.2 Lesson Learn what types of response categories need to be set to missing. Consider if you need to logically recode response options to assist in interpreting your results. See how to collapse a quantitative variable into categories or an already categorical variable into fewer categories. Create secondary variables combining two or more variables using logic statements. Learn how to create a quantitative variable from multiple categorical variables. Begin to think about how these different data management steps might help you best answer your research question. Click on a video lesson below. SAS  R  Python  Stata  SPSS 5.3 Syntax 5.3.1 basic operations 5.3.2 need to identify missing data Often, you must define the response categories that represent missing data. For example, if the number 9 is used to represent a missing value, you must either designate in your program that this value represents missingness or else you must recode the variable into a missing data character that your statistical software will recognize. If you do not, the 9 will be treated as a real/meaningful value and will be included in each of your analyses. SAS if VAR1=9 then VAR1=.; R myData$VAR1[myData$VAR1 == 9 ] &lt;- NA Python myData[&#39;VAR1&#39;]=myData[&#39;VAR1&#39;].replace(9, numpy.nan) STATA replace VAR1=. if VAR1==9 SPSS RECODE var1 (9=SYSMIS). 5.3.3 recoding based on skip patterns There are a number of skip patterns in some data sets. For example, if we ask someone whether or not they have ever used marijuana, and they say no, it would not make sense to ask them more detailed questions about their marijuana use (e.g. quantity, frequency, onset, impairment, etc.). When analyzing more detailed questions regarding marijuana (e.g. have you ever smoked marijuana daily for a month or more?), those individuals that never used the substance may show up as missing data (often designated legitimate skip). Since they have never used marijuana, we can assume that their answer is no, they have never smoked marijuana daily. This would need to be explicitly recoded. Note that we commonly code a no as 0 and a yes as 1. SAS if VAR1=. then VAR1=0; R myData$VAR1[is.na(myData$VAR1)] &lt;- 0 Python myData[&#39;VAR1&#39;].fillna(0, inplace=True) STATA replace VAR1=. if VAR1==9 SPSS RECODE VAR1 (SYSMIS=0). 5.3.4 string variable to numeric variable It is important when preparing to run statistical analyses that all variables have response categories that are numeric rather than string or character. All variables with string or character responses must therefore be recoded into numeric values. These numeric values are known as dummy codes in that they carry no direct numeric meaning. SAS if tree=&#39;Maple&#39; then tree_new=1; else if tree=&#39;Oak&#39; then tree_new=2; R Not necessary in R Python def TREE_N (row) : if row[&#39;TREE&#39;] == &#39;Maple&#39; : return 1 if row[&#39;TREE&#39;] == &#39;Oak&#39; : return 2 myData[&#39;TREE_N&#39;] = myData.apply(lambda row: TREE_N (row), axis = 1) STATA generate TREE_N=. replace TREE_N=1 if TREE==&quot;Maple&quot; replace TREE_N=2 if TREE==&quot;Oak&quot; OR by using the encode command encode TREE, gen(TREE_N) SPSS RECODE TREE (&#39;Maple&#39;=1) (&#39;Oak&#39;=2) INTO TREE_N. 5.3.5 collapsing response categories If a variable has many response categories, it can be difficult to interpret the statistical analyses in which it is used. Alternatively, there may be too few subjects or observations identified by one or more response categories to allow for a successful analysis. In these cases, you would need to collapse across categories. For example, if you have the following categories for geographic region, you may want to collapse some of these categories: Region: New England=1, Middle Atlantic=2, East North Central=3, West North Central=4, South Atlantic=5, East South Central=6, West South Central=7, Mountain=8, Pacific=9. New_Region: East=1, West=2. SAS if region=1 or region=2 or region=3 or region=5 or region=6 then new_region=1; else if region=4 or region=7 or region=8 or region=9 then new_region=2; R myData$new_region[myData$region == 1 | myData$region == 2 | myData$region == 3 | myData$region == 5 | myData$region == 6] &lt;- 1 myData$new_region[myData$region == 4 | myData$region == 7 | myData$region == 8 | myData$region == 9] &lt;-2 Python def new_region (row) : if row[&#39;region&#39;] == 1 or row[&#39;region&#39;] == 2 or row[&#39;region&#39;] == 3 or row[&#39;region&#39;] row[&#39;region&#39;] ==5 or row[&#39;region&#39;] == 6 : return 1 elif row[&#39;region&#39;] == 4 or row[&#39;region&#39;] == 7 or row[&#39;region&#39;] == 7 or row[&#39;region&#39;] row[&#39;region&#39;]== 8 or row[&#39;region&#39;] == 9 : return 2 myData[&#39;new_region&#39;] = myData.apply(lambda row: new_region (row), axis=1) STATA generate new_region = 2 replace new_region=1 if region==1 | region==2 | region==3 | region==5 | region==6 SPSS COMPUTE new_region=2. IF (region=1 | region=2 | region=3 | region=5 | region=6) new_region=1. 5.3.6 aggregating across variables In many cases, you will want to combine multiple variables into one. For example, while NESARC measures several individual anxiety disorders, I may be interested in anxiety more generally. In this case I would create a general anxiety variable in which those individuals who received a diagnosis of social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder would be coded yes and those who were free from all of these diagnoses would be coded no. SAS if socphob=1 or gad=1 or specphob=1 or panic=1 or agora=1 or ocd=1 then anxiety=1; else anxiety=0; R myData$anxiety &lt;- rep(0, nrow(myData)) myData$anxiety[myData$socphob == 1 | myData$gad==1 | myData$panic == 1 | myData$agora==1 | myData$ocd == 1] &lt;- 1 myData$anxiety[is.na(myData$socphob) &amp; is.na(myData$gad) &amp; is.na(myData$panic) &amp; is.na(myData$agora) &amp; is.na(myData$ocd)] &lt;- NA Python def anxiety (row) : if row[&#39;socphob&#39;] == 1 or row[&#39;gad&#39;] == 1 or row[&#39;panic&#39;] == 1 or row[&#39;agora&#39;] == 1 or row[&#39;ocd&#39;] == 1 : return 1 else : return 0 myData[&#39;anxiety&#39;] = data.apply(lambda row: anxiety (row), axis = 1) STATA gen anxiety=1 if socphob==1 | gad==1 | specphob==1 | panic==1 | agora==1 | ocd==1 replace anxiety=0 if anxiety==. SPSS IF (socphob=1 | gad=1 | specphob=1 | panic=1 | agora=1 | ocd=1) anxiety=1. RECODE anxiety (SYSMIS=0). 5.3.7 Create a quantitative variable If you are working with a number of items that represent a single construct, it may be useful to create a composite variable/score. For example, I want to use a list of nicotine dependence symptoms meant to address the presence or absence of nicotine dependence (e.g. tolerance, withdrawal, craving, etc.). Rather than using individual binary variables (i.e. nicotine dependence present or absent), I want to examine the construct as a dimensional scale (i.e. number of nicotine dependence symptoms). In this case, I would want to recode each symptom variable so that yes=1 and no=0 and then sum the items so that they represent one composite score (i.e. the number of nicotine dependence symptoms endorsed). SAS nd_sum=sum (of nd_symptom1 nd_symptom2 nd_symptom3 nd_symptom4); R myData$nd_sum &lt;- myData$nd_symptom1 +myData$nd_symptom2 + myData$nd_symptom3 + myData$nd_symptom4 Python myData[&#39;nd_sum&#39;] = myData[&#39;nd_symptom1&#39;] + myData[&#39;nd_symptom2&#39;] + myData[&#39;nd_symptom3&#39;] + myData[&#39;nd_symptom4&#39;] STATA egen nd_sum=rsum(nd_symptom1 nd_symptom2 nd_symptom3 nd_symptom4) SPSS COMPUTE nd_sum=sum(nd_symptom1 nd_symptom2 nd_symptom3 nd_symptom4). 5.3.8 labeling variables Given the often-cryptic names that variables are given, it can sometimes be useful to label them. SAS label VAR1=&#39;label&#39;; R For frequency tables: library (Hmisc) label(myData$VAR1) &lt;- &quot;label&quot; Python Not needed in Python STATA label variable VAR1 &quot;label&quot; SPSS VARIABLE LABELS VAR1 &#39;label&#39;. 5.3.9 renaming variables Given the often-cryptic names that variables are given, it can be useful to give a variable a new name (something that is easier for you to remember and recognize). SAS rename VAR1=newvarname; R names(myData)[names(myData)== &quot;VAR1&quot;] &lt;- &quot;newvarname&quot; Python myData = myData.rename(index=str, columns={&quot;VAR1&quot;: &quot;newvarname&quot;}) STATA rename VAR1 newvarname SPSS COMPUTE newvarname=VAR1. 5.3.10 labeling variable responses/values Given that nominal and ordinal variables have, or are given numeric response values (i.e. dummy codes), it can be useful to label those values so that the labels are displayed in your output. SAS Set up format before the data step. proc format; value formatname 0=&quot;value0label&quot; 1=&quot;value1label&quot; 2=&quot;value2label&quot; 3=&quot;value3label&quot;; Within the data step, tell SAS which variables you would like to format. format VAR1 formatname.; R Because the function doesnt name the existing levels, make sure you have them all in the right order. levels(myData$VAR1) levels(myData$VAR1) &lt;- c(&quot;value0label&quot;, &quot;value1label&quot;, &quot;value2label&quot;, &quot;value3label&quot;) Python Because the function doesnt name the existing levels, make sure you have them all in the right order. myData[&#39;VAR1&#39;]= myData[&#39;VAR1&#39;]..astype(&#39;category&#39;) myData[&#39;VAR1&#39;]= myData[&#39;VAR1&#39;].cat.rename_categories([&quot;value0label&quot;, &quot;value1label&quot;, &quot;value2label&quot;, &quot;value3label&quot;]) STATA label define LABELname1 0 &quot;value0label&quot; 1 &quot;value1label&quot; 2 &quot;value2label&quot; 3 &quot;value3label&quot; label values VAR1 LABELname1 SPSS VALUE LABELS VAR1 0 &#39;value0label&#39; 1 &#39;value1label&#39; 2 &#39;value2label&#39; 3 &#39;value3label&#39;. 5.3.11 sample subset When using large data sets, it is often necessary to subset the data so that you are including only those observations that can assist in answering your particular research question. In these cases, you may want to select your own sample from within the surveys sampling frame. For example, if you are interested in identifying demographic predictors of depression among Type II diabetes patients, you would plan to subset the data to subjects endorsing Type II Diabetes. SAS Put at the end of the data step. if diabetes2=1; R title_of_subsetted_data &lt;- myData[myData$diabetes2 == 1, ] Python title_of_subsetted_data = myData[myData.diabetes2 == 1] STATA Put this after the command. if diabetes2==1 SPSS Must add as command option. /SELECT=diabetes2 EQ 1 5.3.12 comparison groups Often, you will need to create groups for the purpose of making comparisons. It is important to be certain that the groups that you would like to compare are of adequate size and number. For example, if you were interested in comparing complications of depression in parents who had lost a child through miscarriage vs. parents who had lost a child in the first year of life, it would be important to have large enough groups of each. It would not be appropriate to attempt to compare 5000 observations in the miscarriage group to only 5 observations in the first-year group. 5.4 Assignment Submit the program that manages your data and the results that display your data managed variables as frequency tables. Describe the steps that you took in managing your data and write a few sentences that describe what you see in the frequency tables of your managed variables.

Ben Shneiderman 6.1 Overview You have chosen a research question, selected several variables, and implemented data management decisions that will help you answer your research question. Next, you will learnhow to graph your newly managed variables one at a time (i.e. univariate) in order to better visualize their distributions. Univariate graphing is the process of visualizing the distribution of one variable at a time. 6.2 Lesson There are a variety of conventional ways to visualize data - tables, histograms, bar graphs, etc. Learn how to visualize a frequency distribution as a graphical display. See how a bar chart that graphs one categorical variable contains bars representing each category on the xaxis and number or percent of observations on the y-axis. Create a histogram for quantitative variables that plots quantitative intervals on the x-axis and the number or percentage of observations on the y-axis.

W.A. Wallis 8.1 Overview Thus far, we have focused on descriptive statistics. Through our examination of frequency distributions, graphical representations of our variables, and calculations of center and spread, the goal has been to describe and summarize data. Now you will be introduced to inferential statistics. In addition to describing data, inferential statistics allow us to directly test our hypotheses by evaluating our research question (based on a sample) with the goal of generalizing the results to the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Hypothesis testing is one of the most common applications of statistics to real life problems. It is used when we need to make decisions concerning populations on the basis of information on only a sample. A variety of statistical tests are used to arrive at these decisions (e.g., Analysis of Variance, Chi- Square Test of Independence, etc.). 8.2 Lesson Learn about the 4 steps involved in hypothesis testing: specifying the null (Ho) and alternate (Ha) hypotheses; choosing a sample; assessing the evidence; and drawing conclusions. Identify the null hypothesis (Ho) and alternative hypotheses (Ha) for your research question(s). See how to calculate how likely it is to get data like that observed when Ho is true. Understand when to reject the null hypothesis based on the calculated p-value. Compare your calculated p-value to the standard alpha level ( = .05 or 5%). Consider how this allows us to make inferences about the population based on our sample. Click HERE to watch the video lesson. 8.3 Assignment Write out your research question(s). Be sure to remove any words suggesting cause and effect (i.e., use the words associated, related, more likely, less likely, etc.). Also describe the sample you will focus on (e.g., representative sample of U.S. adolescents, representative sample of U.S. adults, individuals who have smoked in their lifetime, older adults between 60 and 95, etc.). Which topic or construct is your explanatory variable? Which is your response variable? What is the variable name of your explanatory and response variables (i.e., your data management variables)? Next, label your explanatory and response variables as categorical or quantitative. If the variable can be either categorical or quantitative (e.g. it is ordered with higher numbers meaning more and lower numbers meaning less) write categorical if it is your explanatory variable and quantitative if it is your response variable. Finally, write the null and alternate hypothesis for your research question. Which statistical test will you need to run in order to answer your research question? Example: Is smoking quantity associated with nicotine dependence? That is, do young adult smokers (my sample) who smoke more cigarettes have a higher likelihood of meeting criteria for nicotine dependence than those who smoke fewer cigarettes? Explanatory variable: smoking quantity (NUMCIGMO_EST - categorical) Response variable: nicotine dependence (TAB12MDX  categorical) Ho = There is no association between smoking quantity and nicotine dependence among young adult smokers. Ha = There is an association between smoking quantity and nicotine dependence among young adult smokers.

Put simply, a significant association does not mean a causal relationship has been established. It is important not to use causal language in the presentation of your findings. 13.2 Lesson Learn about confounding variables (i.e., those variables that explain or account for a significant association between two variables). Consider the ethical reasons behind why some experiments cannot be conducted. Compare and contrast a prospective study and retrospective study in helping determine if a causal relationship exists between two variables.
